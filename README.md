## Introduction <a name = "introduction"></a>

All this is a ready-made solution for the VK api. I am providing you with a file, already with ready-made functions for all operations, so far there is only one, this is 
[`class.php`](/class.php).

Connect the file to your project, and then just call all the necessary functions.
An example of the initial page is shown in `index.php`

There are a lot of methods in the VK api, so I have divided the readme into categories, with each addition of a new method, I will add to the description of functions.

**First, get your token!** Go to the description.



## Users<a name = "user"></a>

Methods for working with user data.

### users.get<a name = "#usersget"></a>
Returns extended user information.

For this method, I have two functions:
- The first one returns only the token. `getUserToken`
- The second returns only the id. `getUserId`

In both functions, it is necessary to pass the first parameter to the user's login, often this is a phone number, and the second parameter is the user's password. `($login, $password)`

### users.getFollowers<a name = "#usersgetfollowers"></a>
Returns a list of user IDs that are subscribers of the user.

There are also two functions for this request.
- The first one is necessary to get a lot of subscribers with their ID. `getFollowersItems`
- The second is to get the number of subscribers currently. `getFollowersCount`

To work, you need to pass the token parameter. `($token)`

### users.getSubscriptions<a name = "#usersgetsubscriptions"></a>
Returns a list of user IDs and public pages that are included in the list of user subscriptions.

There are also two functions for this request.
- The first one is necessary to get a lot of subscriptions with their ID. `getSubscriptionsItems`
- The second is to get the number of subscriptions currently. `getSubscriptionsCount`

To work, you need to pass the token parameter. `($token)`


## Friends<a name = "friends"></a>

Methods for working with friends.

### friends.get<a name = "#friendsget"></a>
Returns a list of the user's friend IDs or extended information about the user's friends (when using the fields parameter).

There are also two functions for this request.
- The first one is necessary to get an array of friends with their id. `getFriendsItems`
- The second is to get the number of users currently `getFriendsCount`

To work, you need to pass the token parameter. `($token)`

### friends.delete<a name = "#friendsdelete"></a>
Removes a user from the friends list or rejects a friend request.

The function for deleting friends accepts an array with the user id and a token. `deleteFriends($id_friend = [], $token)`

If an error occurred (invalid id, error in the process,...), an error will appear, otherwise it will output true.
